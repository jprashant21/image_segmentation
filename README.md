# image_segmentation

Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into different meaningful segments. In medical imaging, these segments often correspond to different tissue classes, organs, pathologies, or other biologically relevant structures.

The deep learning-based method has a great potential to produce better fusion results than conventional methods. Since 2012, several deep convolutional neural network models have been proposed such as VGG, GoogleNet, Residual Net, DenseNet, FCN and U-Net. These models have not only provided state-of-the-art performance for image classification, segmentation, object detection and tracking tasks, but also provide a new point of view for image fusion.
